# Dynamic Evaluation â€“ CLI Agent Execution

This file documents how the fine-tuned CLI assistant (`agent.py`) performs when actually used in a terminal.

I tested 7 real instructions by running them through `agent.py`. The model generated step-by-step instructions, and the first command was simulated using `echo` (dry-run mode).

All outputs were automatically logged to `logs/trace.jsonl`.
